md or rmd files included in the shiny app using `includeMarkdown` is not executable. One can include the html file, but then most of the features of the cerulean theme are not working any longer.

As a workaround see [https://community.rstudio.com/t/shiny-more-rmarkdown-how-handle-both-templates/62857](<https://community.rstudio.com/t/shiny-more-rmarkdown-how-handle-both-templates/62857>).
Simply empty the header in the html file manually. 

One caveat I have not solved yet. In the first row of the shiny app one word is printed. How do I get rid of that?
